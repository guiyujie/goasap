*0.4.7 notes*
  * Added new Repeater & !LinearGoRepeater classes.
  * !LinearGo, !PlayableGroup and sequence classes now sport repeater instances.
  * Added new event types to !GoEvent and playable classes: PAUSE, RESUME and CYCLE.
  * useFrames support added to !LinearGo
  * id property of !PlayableBase changed to playableID (v0.4.8) to avoid conflicts, id was too generic.
  * static _playRetainer property added to !PlayableBase for stashing refs to self during play cycle (v0.4.4)

*0.4.2 notes*

  * Totally new tests package with !GoTestBase class and tutorial classes
  * The tutorial class SizeTweenMG renamed slightly (was Mg) and updated a little
  * !GoItem now sports a smoother defaultPulseInterval of 33
  * Sequence Looping feature added: repeatCount & currentCount props added
  * Sequences now should not be GC'd while running if you don't store a ref to them
  * SequenceCA: Many changes and fixes mostly dealing with _trailingTweens
  * !TweenBencher updated for use with this version.


*0.4.0 notes*

  * IPlayable, IPlayableBase, and !PlayableBase are reorganized so that !PlayableBase does not implement IPlayable. 
  * Sequence.addStepAt parameters were switched to match !DisplayObjectContainer.addChildAt(). 
  * !GoEngine has been rewritten again for some very successful optimization (new charts! [http://www.goasap.org/info.html#benchmarks]), and adds an internal caching mechanism that keeps animations in sync during sequence advance.
  * TweenBencher 1.6 now includes a memory meter so you can keep an eye peeled for memory leaks in your animation systems.
