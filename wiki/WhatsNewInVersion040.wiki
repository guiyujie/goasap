*This is a fairly major update.*

IPlayable, IPlayableBase, and !PlayableBase are reorganized so that !PlayableBase does not implement IPlayable. 

Sequence.addStepAt parameters were switched to match !DisplayObjectContainer.addChildAt(). 

!GoEngine has been rewritten again for some very successful optimization (new charts! [http://www.goasap.org/info.html#benchmarks]), and adds an internal caching mechanism that keeps animations in sync during sequence advance.

!TweenBencher 1.6 now includes a memory meter so you can keep an eye peeled for memory leaks in your animation systems.
