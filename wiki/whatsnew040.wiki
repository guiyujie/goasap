*What's new in version 0.4.0*

This is a major update. 

IPlayable, IPlayableBase, and !PlayableBase are reorganized so that !PlayableBase does not implement IPlayable. 

Sequence.addStepAt parameters were switched to match !DisplayObjectContainer.addChildAt(). 

!GoEngine has been rewritten again for some very successful optimization, and adds an internal caching mechanism that keeps animations in sync during sequence advance.

!TweenBencher 1.6 now includes a memory meter so you can keep an eye peeled for memory leaks in your animation systems.
