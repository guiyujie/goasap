Before you use this project you need to set up a library source path to the src_go folder.

Properties > Flex Build Path (Source Path tab) > click "edit" existing path.

- Run any of the mxml files.
- Each links to a class that extends GoFlexTestBase.
- These files are tutorials. Please read them, tinker with them, and create your own tests!

Enjoy,
